<!--Nice work, all! This has come together nicely. A few comments below asking for clarification or explaining any line edits I made. Just a note on the sections: 

Because you've opted for this layout, you're committed to a nonlinear format. Each section needs to stand alone because your navigation encourages us to choose at will. So make sure that there's no transitional language at the beginning or end of these sections, and that we don't "need" any information from the other sections to give context to another. 

Finally, I'd love to see you hype/tease the story more up top. Make me WANT to click on the sections and see these relationships at work. "The good/bad relationship" doesn't give me enough salient detail to move on as a user. Plumping those headers up will help. 

	Please let me know if you have any questions between now and then! 

Best,
Emily-->

			<p text align="center" class="introtext">College is not just about tests and homework, it's about learning how to be an adult. While the experience isn't the same for everyone, the stereotypical process involves leaving the comfort of parental domain and entering the realm of personal responsibility. The first leg of this journey is usually a dorm, but the next step for many is an even bigger leap into the "real world:" off-campus living.</p>
			<p text align="center" class="introtext">This leap could turn into a pitfall, though, if tensions between landlords and tenants arise. Unfortunately, this is not a rare occasion. Click the icons below explore four relationships between landlords and tenants.<p>

		<h1>GOOD RELATIONSHIPS</h1>
		<h2>Communication is key</h2>
		<!--Each one of these needs to be able to stand entirely alone. We're not going to read them in order, necessarily, so avoid any language that appears to be transition from a previous section.-->
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Not every off-campus experience is a horror story. Katie Wright, a University of Oregon student, said she's always had a good relationship with her landlord.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"You treat them with respect," Wright said regarding landlords. "They're living here too, with a bunch of college students--respect them and their space."</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Wright's landlord has returned this respect with caring assistance. On one occassion, a tenant living above Wright accidentally fired a gunshot while cleaning his gun. The shot went through Wright's ceiling. The landlord was quick to respond to the situation.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"Our landlord and the company we were with handled it so well," Wright said. "A couple days after [the incident] they patched the ceiling. They made sure the guy had to move out a week later."</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">While Wright's experiences have been mostly pleasant, she does know people who have had bad relationships with their landlords. She didn't place the blame on one party or the other, though.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"I think it's both," Wright said. "You can't just blame one side; it's a two way street."</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">While tales of woe exist on the extreme end of the spectrum, for the most part, students like Wright still want to live off campus. A new study from Ball State University concluded that college students from six different college markets would willingly pay 16 percent more in order to live in an off-campus apartment.</p>

			<h1>BAD RELATIONSHIP</h1>
			<h2>One wild lease</h2>
			<!--I'm reading this after the "good" one... so this transition doesn't make sense.-->
				<p class="storyparagraphs">Ball State University students Katie Reece and Katelyn Miller were in the process of looking for an apartment and had seemingly found the perfect match--until they took a closer look at the lease. Upon reading the fine print, Reece and Miller discovered that the landlord had included several restrictive clauses. For one, any appliance or electronic device had to be approved by the landlord. What's more, the two girls couldn't have overnight guests unless they secured the landlord's permission. Faced with those options, they decided not to sign the lease.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Not all students may have this luxury. U.S. News & World Report reported that because of a 38.7 percent increase in student enrollment between 2000 and 2010, many colleges are not able to provide housing for students for all four years. In effect, this makes the off-campus housing market a seller's game.</p>
			<!--Re-read the second sentence in the graf below... not sure what you mean here.-->
			<p class="storyparagraphs">No universal legislation exists to govern landlord-tenant relationships. Rather, tenant rights differ from state to state are listed by the U.S. department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>

		<h1>WORSE COMES TO WORST</h1>
		<h2>When coping fails</h2>
			<!--We haven't been introduced to the concept of "coping mechanisms" as the framing for this story, outside the title.-->
			<!--Could use some more context here if you have it. How long did they live there? Why didn't they move out? Are they still living in the apartment? It seems so. Did you contact the landlord for comment? If he/she didn't respond, you should include that as well.-->
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Coping mechanisms have a breaking point though, and the consequences of a complete communications breakdown can be severe. Emily Burklow, a Northwestern University junior, experienced the failures of a dysfunctional landlord/tenant relationship firsthand.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Before Burklow even moved in to her house last summer, there was trash leftover from previous tenants, leaking faucets and broken smoke detectors. Because she was studying abroad, Burklow's roommates were the first to encounter their landlord.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Burklow attempted to contact her landlord throughout the summer about the mounting issues, including carpenter ants and a door broken off of its hinges. The landlord sent only "cold, unhelpful answers" and allegedly didn't take action to fix problems. Contacting the the university's office of Off-Campus Life didn't help either.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Things only got worse. The basement flooded once in the winter and twice in the spring. The stove broke. Repeated emails to the landlord were ignored. Burklow called her landlord an "unstable character," citing the landlord's unexpected trip to Thailand and her insinuation that she wasn't responsible for repairs.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">"Because she's so evasive, it's hard to expect a middle ground with her," Burklow said.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">When enough was enough, Burklow and her roommates attempted to set up an in-person meeting with their landlord. When they couldn't contact her, one roommate's mother began acting as a lawyer and initiated contact with the landlord in a legal context. While emailing through a lawyer solved some of the problems, a lawsuit has been filed regarding other problems in the house.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">In retrospect, Burklow said that treating everything as urgent from the first moment she and her roommates moved in would've helped. Instead, they've had to pick and choose their battles in the months that followed.</p>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">"We don't know what landlord-tenant relationships are supposed to look like," Burklow said. "Our parents were the ones who had to tell us to get stuff fixed."</p>

		<h1>LANDLORD'S PERSPECTIVE</h1>
		<h2>Life on the fence</h2>
			<p class="storyparagraphs">"I've had my ups and my downs, but honestly it's just refreshing to constantly have the students around me," said RaShia Jones, 46, who has been working as a landlord in Evanston, Illinois for the last 12 years.</p>

			<p class="storyparagraphs">Jones is one of three property managers for Evanston Apartments and owns several rental spots across the city of Evanston. Most of their property, however, is centered at the cross section of Foster and Maple, just four blocks away from Northwestern University. "Having our office located under our main rental property keeps us close to the students that lease from us so that we are always available to discuss any issues on hand as well as let us keep an eye on what they do on our properties. It really works out for both parties."</p>

			<!--I'd love to un-comment the quote about the red cups. It adds some color! Didn't do it in case you were cutting for reasons I'm unware of.-->

			<p class="storyparagraphs">To hedge against the potential property damage that might occur at a party, Jones said that her company places a limit on the number of people allowed in a unit at a given time. According to the lease she has tenants sign, they can't have more than twice the people living in the space. "I know that they have parties, I'm not dumb. They're in college and they like to have fun, but from a legal standpoint I like to be covered as well. We want the safeguards in place in case something does happen and they try to blame us for it. <!--I remember in particular one Monday driving in to our back lot and seeing a trash bag filled with those red cups sitting on top of the dumpster and all I could do was shake my head and send out an email restating our policy when it comes to guests, but what else could I do?-->"</p>

			<p class="storyparagraphs">	Adam Snyder, 20, a tenant at the property above the office said that Jones stops often to talk to him and his roommates whenever they cross paths in the parking lot or building. "<!--In the fall I had marching band practice most afternoons and whenever she would see me with my trombone she would tell me to keep up the good work and though it's not much it is something that I wouldn't have expected from a landlord coming into this year.--> She is the first landlord I've dealt with and she completely changed the picture I had of a stern authority figure type who just wants my money. She just seems to always have a smile on <!-- and that is part of the reason why my roommates and I decided to stay here for next year-->."</p>

			<p class="storyparagraphs"><!--	But that is not the only reason that Snyder decided to stay for another year at his same unit. -->Snyder also said that his lease included many other perks that he and his roommates were automatically opted into such as a monthly maid service. "At first we thought it was some sort of scam type thing since our building is also the office space for the Dial-A-Maid service. But to be honest, I live with three other guys and for maids to come and help keep our place clean is just nice.<!-- It is just nice to be able to feel like our place is kept to a higher standard than most of my friend's apartments and it being part of our lease made it simple. Sometimes we forget that they're coming and it can get awkward but for the most part it's nothing but helpful.-->"</p>

			<p class="storyparagraphs">	"The maid service is the first thing that the students like to question," said Jones. "But it is also the first thing that tell us they loved the most about renting from us when they leave. These college kids don't realize at first what comes with living off-campus for the first time and this helps them transition just that much easier."</p>

			<!--Cut the bit about her being an atypical landlord b/c you don't have the data to support that.-->
			<p class="storyparagraphs">Jones says that she wouldn't want to ever make the switch to renting out only to professional adults. To her, the students become her kids and she likes watching how they grow over the months and years that they rent from her. "I like being able to be the first landlord that these kids are able to deal with. There are a lot of sharks out there and I want to make sure that they know that not everything they hear about the tenant-landlord relationship is true. There are a couple of us nice ones out there!"</p>
